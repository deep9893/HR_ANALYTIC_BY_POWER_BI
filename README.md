# HR_ANALYTIC_BY_POWER_BI


The goal is to understand and find out why Employee churn. The project features an HR analytics dashboard, which is divided into three filters, namely human resources, research and development, and sales.
To accurately measure employee performance and retention, I have utilized several key performance indicators (KPIs), such as employee count, attrition, attrition rate, average age, average salary, and average years worked for the company.

The whole process involved the following:
1 - Fetch the Data
2 - Data Cleaning and Transformation
3 - Dax Functions
4 - Creating a Dashboard using appropriate visualization like Area Chart, Donut Chart, Clustered Column Chart, etc.

This Dashboard is about the Attrition of Employees of the organization. So, I came up with some key Insights:

1 - Around 69% of employees left the organization because their salary is up to 5000.

2 - According to gender "Male" employees no. are more than "Female" employees.

3 - The insight that 26-35-year-old employees have the highest attrition rate is notable. It would be useful to investigate the reasons for this trend, such as lack of work-life balance, opportunities for career growth, or job satisfaction. The organization could conduct exit interviews to gather feedback from employees who have left to identify the reasons for their departure and use that information to make targeted improvements.

4 - The finding that 38% of employees who left the organization come from a life sciences background in education is significant. It would be beneficial to investigate whether there are any issues related to job satisfaction or career growth opportunities within this field that are contributing to the high attrition rate. Additionally, it may be useful to explore how the organization can better support employees with backgrounds in life sciences to improve retention rates and promote a positive workplace culture.
